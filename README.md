# DissertationProject
Work for my dissertation final year project at university.

Created in Pycharm, the software is capable of attempting to scrape tweets from Twitter. If this fails, it uses a static dataset to showcase the capabilities of the software.

Users are able to change settings, such as changing the shape of the wordclouds to create (cloud shape, diamond, square, triangle), the dates to gather data between from Twitter, and if they want multiple wordclouds to be created.

Users are required to input a hashtag to create the wordclouds. The wordclouds represent the highest-trending words used related to a specific topic.

If the software creates multiple wordclouds, each of them are showcased in an mp4 file, so that users are able to analyse the data given to them.

Every wordcloud and video produced by the software are stored in the local directory.
